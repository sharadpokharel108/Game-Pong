# Game-Pong
The game pong is not new for us.  The pong game features simple graphics and gameplay, where players control paddles on the left and right side of the screen and must use them to hit a small dot, representing a ball, back and forth across the screen. The aim is to score points by making the ball hit the opponent's side of the screen without it hitting the player's side.
